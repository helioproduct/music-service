[Chorus: Madonna]
Just one of those things
When everything goes incredible
And all is beautiful
(Can't, can't, can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)
(Can't get my head around, I-I need to think about it)
And all of those things that used to get you down now have no effect at all
'Cause life is beautiful
(Can't, can't, can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)
(Can't get my head around, I-I need to think about it)

[Verse 1: Madonna]
Remembering the very first time
You caught that someone special's eye
And all of your care dropped
And all of the world just stopped

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
(I hope)
I wanna go back to then
Gotta figure out how, gotta remember where
I felt it (Hmm)
It thrilled me (Hmm)
I want it (Hmm)
To fill me
See pop shows near Amsterdam
Get tickets as low as $81

[Chorus: Madonna]
Just one of those things
When everything goes incredible
And all is beautiful
(Can't, can't, can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)
(Can't get my head around, I-I need to think about it)
And all of those things that used to get you down don't have no effect at all
'Cause life is beautiful
(Can't, can't, can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)(Can't get my head around, I-I need to think about it)

[Verse 2: Madonna]
You don't know what you got 'til it's gone
And everything in life just goes wrong
Feels like nobody's listenin'
And something is missing

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
(I hope)
I wanna go back to then
Gotta figure out how, gotta remember where (Hmm)
I felt it (Hmm)
It thrilled me (Hmm)
I want it (Hmm)
To fill me

[Chorus: Madonna]
Just one of those things
When everything goes incredible
And all is beautiful
(Can't, can't, can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)
(Can't get my head around, I-I need to think about it)
And all of those things that used to get you down don't have no effect at all
'Cause life is beautiful
(Can't, can't, can't get my head around it, I need to think about it)
(Can't get my head around, I-I need to think about it)
[Interlude: Madonna]
I remember when
You were the one
You were my friend
You gave me life
You were the sun
You taught me things
I didn't run
I fell to my knees
I didn't know why
I started to breathe
I wanted to cry
I need a reminder so I can relate
I need to go back there before it's too late

[Bridge: Madonna]
It's time to get your hands up
It's time to get your body moving
It's time to get your hands up
It's time to get your body moving
It's time to get your hands up
It's time to get your body moving
It's time to get your hands up
It's time to get your body moving
